## SCC-Coloring-Algorithm (Parallel)

Parallel implementation of a graph coloring algorithm using
pthreads, OpenMP, and Cilk.

Focus on performance comparison and scalability across parallel models.
Developed as part of a parallel computing course.

You can find out more about the algorithm in this [paper](BFS_and_Coloring-Based_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Strongly_Connected_Components_and_Related_Problems.pdf).
