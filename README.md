## SCC-Coloring Algorithm (Parallel)

Parallel implementation of a graph coloring algorithm using
pthreads, OpenMP, and Cilk.

Focus on performance comparison and scalability across different
parallel programming models.

Based on the SCC coloring approach and developed as part of a
parallel computing course.
