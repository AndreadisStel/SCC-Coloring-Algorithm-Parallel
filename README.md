## SCC-Coloring-Algorithm (Parallel)

Parallel implementation of a graph coloring algorithm using
pthreads, OpenMP, and Cilk.

Focus on performance comparison and scalability across parallel models.
Developed as part of a parallel computing course.

You can find out more about the algorithm in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6877288).\
You can learn more about the task in the [assignment](SCC-Algorithm-Assignment.pdf).
